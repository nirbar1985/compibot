create_trust_anchor
create_trust_anchor(**kwargs)
Creates a trust anchor. You establish trust between IAM Roles Anywhere and your certificate authority (CA) by configuring a trust anchor. A Trust Anchor is defined either as a reference to a AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority (ACM PCA), or by uploading a Certificate Authority (CA) certificate. Your AWS workloads can authenticate with the trust anchor using certificates issued by the trusted Certificate Authority (CA) in exchange for temporary AWS credentials.

Required permissions: rolesanywhere:CreateTrustAnchor .

Note

This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following top level keys will be set: acmPcaArn, x509CertificateData. If a client receives an unknown member it will set SDK_UNKNOWN_MEMBER as the top level key, which maps to the name or tag of the unknown member. The structure of SDK_UNKNOWN_MEMBER is as follows:

'SDK_UNKNOWN_MEMBER': {'name': 'UnknownMemberName'}
acmPcaArn (string) --

The root certificate of the Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority specified by this ARN is used in trust validation for CreateSession operations. Included for trust anchors of type AWS_ACM_PCA .

x509CertificateData (string) --
